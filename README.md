# Neighborhood-map
This is a Udacity neighborhood map project from Front-end development Nanodegree. It's including restuarants neer to my location.

## How to:
1. Start by opening `index.html`
1. A map with a predefined location should load (if not you will get an error message with a summary)
1. On the left, you will find all **Food Venues** loaded by [foursquare icon] (./img/fs-32.svg =16x16) Foursquare API; divided into **Filters** (or Categories) above, and **Restaurants** below.
	Each **Restaurant** has a corresponding **Marker** on the map.
1. Click on a Filter in the list to filter out both the restaurants below, as well as the markers on the map.
	When you apply a filter, an icon [filter icon] (./img/filter.svg =16x16) will appear on the list header, clicking on it will remove the filter, restoring all the **Restaurants** and **Markers**.
1. Click on a **Restaurant** from the list, or a **Marker** on the map to show more info about the restaurant.
