# How to:
1. Start by opening `index.html`
2. A map with a predefined location should load (if not you will get an error message with a summary)
3. On the left, you will find all **Food Venues** loaded by ![foursquare icon](./img/fs-32.svg =16x16) Foursquare API; divided into **Filters** (or Categories) above, and **Restaurants** below.
	Each **Restaurant** has a corresponding **Marker** on the map.
4. Click on a Filter in the list to filter out both the restaurants below, as well as the markers on the map.
	When you apply a filter, an icon ![filter icon](./img/filter.svg =16x16) will appear on the list header, clicking on it will remove the filter, restoring all the **Restaurants** and **Markers**.
5. Click on a **Restaurant** from the list, or a **Marker** on the map to show more info about the restaurant.
